**Usage:**

```python main.py <input folder> <output folder>```

All PLY meshes in the input folder will be remeshed with Amira and will be saved in OBJ format in the output folder. Search for the **amira_cmd** variable in **main.py** and set it to the executable Amira file (e.g., **/local/AmiraZIBEdition-2016.20/bin/AmiraZIBEdition**).
